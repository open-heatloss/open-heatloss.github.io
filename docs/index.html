    <h1>Open Heatloss</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">A computer vision dataset to fight climate change.</h2>

    <p>
      For the last 15 years, the French government has subsidized
      energy-efficient home renovations. To qualify, homeowners must obtain a
      detailed report from a certified thermal expert. These reports are
      publicly available as part of an open data initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open Heatloss is the first open academic initiative to curate, augment and
      distribute this data for ecological machine learning challenges.

    <h3>Open Heatloss Tasks</h3>
    <p>
      We offer two challenges that leverage the best of the data we distribute:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Heat loss prediction: a single number for the raw calorific power
        exiting the house, normalized by house surface and average outside
        temperature, giving a <b>W/K/m2</b>. The metric is the mean squared
        error to the target on the test set.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat loss distribution across seven different core component: walls,
        windows, etc. The metric is the average <b>cross-entropy</b> between the
        predicted distribution and the target on the test set.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The ADEME DPE dataset</h3>
    <p>
      The ADEME manages and publishes the experts' reports on residential homes.
      Unfortunately, the quality of the reports is highly variable and the whole
      sector has been infamous in France for its unreliability. There is a lot
      of curation done by Ecair experts to sort out poor reports.
    </p>
    <p>We will publish an initial version of this dataset by December 2024.</p>

    <h3>Satellite augmentation</h3>
    <p>
      The French geographical institute (IGN) publishes "satellite" (aerial)
      images free of charge and distribution, which we pair with the ADEME data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The making of the dataset is dependent on the precision of the geocoding
      of the addresses - and it's all in all a hard task as the signal contained
      in the images is not always enough to do proper inference.
    </p>
    <p>We will publish an initial version of this dataset by December 2024.</p>

    <h3>Google Street View augmentation</h3>
    <p>
      There are data challenges Google takes seriously with Street View data
      that hinders its academic distribution, but we're actively working with an
      initiative inside the organisation to make a version publicly available
      that doesn't break their Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <p>Work in progress, expecting release by Q1 or Q2 2025</p>
